gInbox is a wrapper made for Mac around Inbox by Gmail.

This eliminates your need to use a tab on Chrome to make it work.

Currently it only acts as a windowed-tab, that unlike Google Chrome in app mode, will not be eliminated when you close the window, forcing you to reopen the address; but instead resides in the background as a normal OS X app would.

Feel free to open requests and issues in the repository!
